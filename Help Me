status = "VERIFIED" if hash1 == hash2 else "HASH_MISMATCH"

Here’s what happens:
The video is downloaded.
The script calculates SHA256 → hash1
The file is moved to final destination.
The script calculates SHA256 again → hash2
If both hashes match → VERIFIED

What That Confirms
It confirms:
The file was not corrupted during move
No modification occurred between write and final storage
The file you logged is the exact file stored

It does NOT confirm:
That YouTube content itself is authentic
That the video wasn’t edited before upload
That the source URL is legitimate
It only verifies local file integrity during acquisition.
If hashes differ, you get:

HASH_MISMATCH
Which means corruption or modification occurred.
